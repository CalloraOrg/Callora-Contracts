//! Adversarial authorization regression tests for the upgrade entry points
//! (`set_cooldown`, `check_and_record_upgrade`) — issue #1058.
//!
//! Every upgrade entry point must fail closed when the caller has not
//! authorized the invocation — even when every other precondition is
//! satisfied. These tests would fail if a future change removed
//! `caller.require_auth()` from either entry point, or allowed a failed call
//! to mutate state.
