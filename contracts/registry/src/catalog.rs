//! External catalog interface invoked by the registry during offering registration.
//!
//! Production deployments point `init`'s `catalog` address at a contract that
//! persists offering metadata (for example an on-chain catalog or vault hook).
//! Integration tests swap in mock callees that revert or panic to exercise
//! cross-contract failure safety.
//!
//! # Cross-contract trust boundary (issue #1060)
//!
//! `registry` is the address of the contract performing the cross-contract
//! call. A catalog implementation **must** treat this as a caller-supplied
//! identity and enforce it before recording anything: the first statement of
//! `put_offering` must be `registry.require_auth()`. That check succeeds only
//! when the invocation actually originates from the registry contract (the
//! host authorizes the immediate contract caller), and fails closed for any
//! other caller — including a spoofing contract that passes the registry's
//! address as an argument. Without this check any contract could call the
//! catalog directly with an arbitrary `registry` value and inject unverified
//! offering metadata at a trust boundary.
//!
//! See `contracts/registry/tests/xcontract.rs` (`identity_catalog`) for a
//! reference implementation and adversarial coverage of this boundary.
